# Heart-Failure-Prediction
The aim of this model is to predict whether a patient is going to have a heart failure or not based on certain input features. After that, weâ€™re going to evaluate and find out how well our model is working.
The dataset includes different parameters which are helpful to cut down the chase and helps us to know the target variable.
